# E-commerce Task

## Description
I was tasked to create an e-commerce back-end. The user can view/create/update/delete products, categories, or tags. This included the use of a MySQL database and api routing. I used the program Insomnia to check if the api routes were working to update data within the database.

## Built With

* Node js
* Express js
* JavaScript
* [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)
* [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

## Installation
Dependencies:

```npm install express mysql2 sequelize dotenv ```

Use schema.sql to create the database using MySQL shell commands then use ```npm run seed ``` to seed the tables. 

Use a .env file for sensitive data storage.
